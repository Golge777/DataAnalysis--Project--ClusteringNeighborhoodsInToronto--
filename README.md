In this repository, I cluster neighborhoods of Toronto using k-Means approach and show them clustered on Toronto map. I obtained the raw data from the Wikipedia page. After getting the data and structered into a panda dataframe, I clear it and show the neighborhoods in a clustered form on a folium map.
